Are average scores for hospital quality or procedural variability correlated with 
patient survey responses?


For this test of the correlation, we will test the overall rating achievement score
from the survey results with both the average effective care score of the hospital
and the hospital readmission rate.  The correlation was not run against the procedural
variability because the survey results do not indicate the medical procedure that the
survey result is in response to.

By effective care score, the correlation of hospital quality with patient survey
responses is -0.036624826883850964.  So there is no correlation between the two
scores.

By readmission score, the correlation of hospital quality with patient survey responses
is -0.4109550450155804. This indicates that there is a moderate negative correlation 
between the readmission score of a hospital and the patient survey responses.  The 
negative correlation is due to a lower readmission rate is tied to a successful 
medical procedure and by association, a more positive patient experience.
